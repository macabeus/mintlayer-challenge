This application fetches the tickers list and history by [Bitfinex API](https://docs.bitfinex.com/reference).

## Some implementation highlights

- Since Bitfinex API doesn't allow requests by `localhost` (otherwise, we'll have a CORS error), we are using [`webpack-dev-server`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) to proxy the request.
- We are using the package [`swr`](https://swr.vercel.app/) provides cache from the API, wrapped by the custom hook [`useResource`](src/hooks/useResource.ts).
- Since this application is simple enough, the global state management is provided by [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
